        <p>The Network Connection Manager (NetworkConnectionMgr) allows an administrator to set preferences for device connection to cellular (WWAN) and Wi-Fi (WLAN) networks to help ensure that the best possible network is connected at all times.  </p>

<p>FROM APA: 
As a device admin, I want to have the ability to manage and control the selection between cellular WWAN subscriptions and WLAN networks, so that I can maximize connectivity by optimizing when and how each potentially available network is used. This is important to have the connectivity all the time with the best available network.</p>

<p>As a device admin, I’d like to be able to Enable/Disable connection manager enhancement feature in multiple/all devices belonging to me, so that I can choose to use this feature when it will add value and not use it when it would add little value or perhaps negatively impact my operations.</p>

<p>As a device admin, I’d like to be able to Add/Remove WWAN/WLAN Access points to the priority list in multiple/all devices belonging to me, so that I can make this feature work according to the network changes or SIM card changes in the device.</p>

<p>As a device admin, I’d like to be able to provide the access points list in a priority order in multiple/all devices belonging to me, so that I can choose the networks to be given higher priority and lower priority among all the WWAN and WLAN networks.</p>

<p>As a device admin, I’d like to be able to change the prioritization configs (Min Signal Level for Connection of Access Point and Refresh Interval) in multiple/all devices belonging to me, so that I can choose to connect WWAN or WLAN network which is having the better signal levels. This is important to specify the refresh interval which can have an impact on the battery consumption.</p>
