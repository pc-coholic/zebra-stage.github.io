        <p>Used to enter one or more custom rules by which to restrict USB peripheral usage when the device is in USB Host Mode. Allowed peripherals can be categorized by device class (sometimes referred to as device "type"), vendor ID (VID) and/or product ID (PID). </p>

<p>More than one rule can apply to the same peripheral. For example, there could be a rule to allow all peripherals of the "printer" class by specifying the appropriate numeric device class for printers (07h). Under this rule, <em>all</em> printers would be usable. There could be a separate rule to allow all "Zebra" peripherals by specifying the appropriate numeric vendor code for Zebra (0A5F). If those two rules existed at once, a Zebra printer would be usable under either rule whenever the device with the Custom Rules option selected is in USB Host Mode. If either of those rules were deleted, Zebra printers would remain usable. A peripheral is usable if there is <em>at least one rule that allows it</em>, and unusable if there are <strong><em>NO</em></strong> rules that allow it.</p>
