What is IoT Connector?
======================

``Zebra IoT Connector`` provides cloud-based management, control, RFID tag data and Management Events collection for Zebra's fixed RFID reader portfolio (``FX7500``, ``FX9600``, and ``ATR7000``). 

The ``Zebra IoT Connector`` feature enables connectivity to a cloud platform to provide IoT capabilities to the reader. Once connected, the readers can be managed and controlled using a REST API interface; while tag data can be pushed to an asynchronous consumer of choice.
