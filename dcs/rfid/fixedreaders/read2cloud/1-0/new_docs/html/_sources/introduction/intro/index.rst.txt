What is IoT Connector?
======================

``Zebra IoT Connector`` provides cloud-based management, control, RFID tag data and Management Events collection for Zebra's fixed RFID reader portfolio (``FX7500``, ``FX9600``, and ``ATR7000``). 

The ``Zebra IoT Connector`` feature enables connectivity to a cloud platform to provide IoT capabilities to the reader. Once connected, the readers can be managed and controlled using a REST API interface; while tag data can be pushed to an asynchronous consumer of choice.

Once connected to the cloud, the readers can be managed and controlled using a REST API interface via the cloud. The reader tag data is also pushed
to the cloud to be consumed by the cloud service.

The ``Zebra IoT Connector`` feature provides the three interfaces as listed below.
    * **Management interface**: Used to perform management actions on the reader (for example, firmware upgrade, getting reader configuration, and setting reader configuration).
    * **Control interface**: Used to perform control actions on the reader (for example, configuring the radio mode, starting/stopping the tag reads).
    * **Tag Data Event interface**: Used to consume the RFID tag data from the reader.
    * **Management Event interface**: Used to consume the Asynchronous management events from the reader.

    These interfaces can be configured independently to allow for access via cloud or locally within the private network. Depending on how the ``Zebra IoT Connector`` interfaces are configured, there are three possible deployment modes as described in the chapter :ref:`Deployment Modes`.
